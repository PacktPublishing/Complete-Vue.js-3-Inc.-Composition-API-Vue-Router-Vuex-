Notes before starting "Complete Vue.js"

Welcome!

This course was completely re-recorded in April, 2021. It is generally re-recorded once a year, to keep everything up to date. It now uses the latest versions of Vue 3, Vuex and Vue Router and Vite available and the time of recording.

Ideally, you will install the exact same versions of Vite and Vue as I'm using. That will make sure everything works as expected. If you want to use a newer version, or use the Vue CLI, that's fine too - just post if you get stuck and I'll help you out.

Here is link to the source code for the course: https://github.com/lmiller1990/complete-vuejs

The *master* branch has the completed code, and the *getting-started* branch has a fresh template without any code.

Thanks and enjoy!
